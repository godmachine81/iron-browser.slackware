SRWare Iron is developed by SRware
Modified and customized by Lance Poore <LinuxSociety@gmail.com>

This is a customized build of SRWare's Iron Browser (based on Chromium/Chrome)

This browser has been heavily modified to remove ALL google tracking services and any privacy related components

*Add built-in support for Flash Player
*Add built-in support for PDF plugin to view PDF files in Iron
*Add built-in support for GoogleTalk Plugin (allows using hangouts, googlevoice from gmail, and Gtalk video/audio conferences)

The current version will remain behind Chromium/Chromes stable tree by one release at most times (this is perfectly normal)


Currently I am providing pkgs/slackbuilds for x86_64 only!

Enjoy!
